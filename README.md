# üöó Vehicle Counter: AI-Powered Traffic Monitoring

The **Vehicle Counter** is a cutting-edge program designed for real-time vehicle detection and tracking. By leveraging **background subtraction** and the powerful **dlib correlation tracker**, this application enables accurate and efficient counting of vehicles passing through a designated area. Its modular design makes it easy to extend with advanced object detection frameworks like YOLO or HOG+SVM.
